        Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill.
         To amuse himself, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!” 
         The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. 
         They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.
